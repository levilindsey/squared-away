// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// ---------- SOON
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //

- add the guts to the different game-logic JS prototypes

- have circular progress indicators around the borders of the preview windows which indicate how soon it will be before the shown block is dropped

- add the shimmer animation to the tiles
    - make this a regularly occurring thing for each entire BLOCK
	- make this a completely randomly occuring thing for each stationary SQUARE

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// ---------- EVENTUALLY
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //

- Time functions:
	- USE PHP to get the login/logoff/visit times that are saved for each user
	- USE JS to get the machine's local time at start and for calculating durations and whatnot
- Cookies:
	- store the username for auto-filling login info
- re-factor the Block code to only use one manner of position information
- the ability to toggle different game modes will be unlocked by getting through later levels (and this data is saved to the user's account)

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// ---------- PLANNING
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //

- ASK JUSTIN AND ALDEN FOR FEEDBACK!
    - and music (Justin's bro's band; Alden for original stuff)
	- OR, just make something easy from one of my ideas on my phone (or from long ago compositions)

- Plan the exact user input/controls for playing the game
- Think through all possible details of the game playing behavior
    - How do completed layers collapse?
- Plan the layout of the main game area, the preview windows for each side, the banner, the description below.
    - Be minimalistic!  (have content dynamically display if the user asks (taps) for it?)
- Plan the art and all small animation details
- Plan music and SFX (i.e., ask Alden when the game is demoable)
- Plan how to create accounts and log in on the screen
- Plan how to show personal history
- Plan how to show community history (how many users, high scores)
- Plan SQL database:
    - How to save user profiles (name, email, username, all score/time/actions history, devices)
	- How to save gameplays (start time, end time, tiles given (when/where/what), action history)
	- How to save current state (so the user can come back to continue later)
	- How to save login visits (which device, when opened, when closed, when went idle, ...)
- Plan unlockables/achievements:
    - When getting past certain difficulty levels (from the very start)
    - When playing quickly enough
    - New tile/GUI art
    - New music?

- say at the bottom of the info bit that the site uses cookies?

Most of the main game logic in place:
	Tile behavior:
		Tiles of the right shape are previewed and then fall
		Tiles fall from all sides
		Tiles fall with randomized times within windows according to current difficulty
		Tiles are rendered with simple rect drawing to canvas
		Tiles fall gradually to the center
		Tiles spawn and come to rest
		Tile fall rate and spawn rate increases
		Collapse of complete layers is implemented
	User input:
		Actually capture the mouse tap and button press events on PCs and the finger tap and swipe events on mobile devices
		All user controls and actions are implemented

Tiles
Phantom line/position markings
Play area background
Surrounding area background
Borders
Create a pictoral description of how to play the game (for internationalization)
	But do also include a button in a corner with the i in a circle which represents info or more help

The code for animating all of the block behavior:
	Rotating
	Sliding both sideways and down
	Switching fall directions/sides
	Periodic "shimmers"
	Complete layer collapse disintegration effect
	Rendering of phantom lines/positions for user tile-movement events
Displaying time and current difficulty level
Miscellaneous aesthetic touches

SFX events triggered
Sound overlaying/interacting behavior figured out
Music looping behavior
Music switching behavior
Sound controls (with icons):
	Toggle music
	Toggle SFX
