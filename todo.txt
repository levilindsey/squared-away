// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// ---------- SOON
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //

- add the guts to the different game-logic JS prototypes

- have circular progress indicators around the borders of the preview windows which indicate how soon it will be before the shown block is dropped

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// ---------- EVENTUALLY
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //

- Time functions:
	- USE PHP to get the login/logoff/visit times that are saved for each user
	- USE JS to get the machine's local time at start and for calculating durations and whatnot
- Cookies:
	- store the username for auto-filling login info

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// ---------- PLANNING
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //

- Plan the exact user input/controls for playing the game
- Think through all possible details of the game playing behavior
    - How do completed layers collapse?
- Plan the layout of the main game area, the preview windows for each side, the banner, the description below.
    - Be minimalistic!  (have content dynamically display if the user asks (taps) for it?)
- Plan the art and all small animation details
- Plan music and SFX (i.e., ask Alden when the game is demoable)
- Plan how to create accounts and log in on the screen
- Plan how to show personal history
- Plan how to show community history (how many users, high scores)
- Plan SQL database:
    - How to save user profiles (name, email, username, all score/time/actions history, devices)
	- How to save gameplays (start time, end time, tiles given (when/where/what), action history)
	- How to save current state (so the user can come back to continue later)
	- How to save login visits (which device, when opened, when closed, when went idle, ...)
- Plan unlockables/achievements:
    - When getting past certain difficulty levels (from the very start)
    - When playing quickly enough
    - New tile/GUI art
    - New music?

- say at the bottom of the info bit that the site uses cookies?
