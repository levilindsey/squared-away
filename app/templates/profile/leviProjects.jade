    dt A Tile-Matching Puzzle Game Web App (2013)
    dd
      a(href='../squaredaway') This web app
      | was simply a toy project, which gave Levi the opportunity to practice his web development skills. Levi will soon create a separate Android app version of this game.
    dt Sketch Recognition (2013)
    dd
      | Levi developed a novel algorithm for real-time gesture recognition from ink data. This was extended from work done in a UCR course on Pen-Based Computing algorithms and techniques.
    dt Wedding Website (2012)
    dd
      a(href='../wedding') This website
      | was used as the invite, RSVP system, and source of general information for Jackie and Levi&apos;s wedding.
    dt Blind-Accessible Android Navigation Application (2011)
    dd
      | In the UW CS accessibility capstone course (CSE 481h) Levi co-developed a route-orienting application which would guide a blind user via vibrational feedback. This application would first geocode the user&apos;s current location and a user-entered destination and then query the Google Directions API for a route from the one to the other. This route was then displayed on a map with the userâ€™s current location. The user could then rotate the phone around, and the phone would vibrate when pointed in the direction of the current step in the user&apos;s route. This involved the creation of a completely novel blind-accessible soft keyboard in addition to the implementation of a database for storing previously entered destinations. The PhoneWand code is open source and online at: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/mobileaccessibility/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FPhoneWand</a>.

  h2 Work Experience
  dl
    dt Graduate Student Researcher (2011-2013)
    dd
      | At UCR, Levi worked with Professor
      a(href='http://www.engr.ucr.edu/faculty/me/stahovich.html', target='_blank') Tom Stahovich
      | in the
      a(href='http://smarttools.engr.ucr.edu/', target='_blank') Smart Tools lab
      | (10/11-6/13).  Levi led the development of pair of a statics tutorial systems which were used in undergraduate classes to help students tackle the difficult tasks of constructing free-body diagrams and deriving their corresponding equilibrium equations. The first version of this system runs on tablet computers with a standard computer interface, and the other runs on
      a(href="http://www.livescribe.com', target='_blank') Livescribe smartpens
      | with specially designed paper worksheets.  Here is his
      a(href'../documents/levi_thesis.pdf') Master&apos;s thesis
      | discussing this research.
    dt Teaching Assistant (2012-2013)
    dd
      | At UCR, Levi taught two courses for two quarters each. The first was Introduction to Computer Science and the second was Software Construction.
    dt Software Developer Intern (2011)
    dd
      | Levi spent the summer of 2011 as an intern at
      a(href='http://www.voicebox.com/', target='_blank') VoiceBox Technologies
      | in Bellevue, Washington, where he implemented a noise suppression algorithm and incorporated noise suppression functionality into VBT's original voice activity detection module.
    dt Undergraduate Researcher (2010-2011)
    dd
      | During his undergraduate studies at UW, Levi spent more than a year (4/10-6/11) working with Professor
      a(href='http://www.ee.washington.edu/faculty/mamishev/', target='_blank') Alexander Mamishev
      | in the
      a(href='http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/seal/', target='_blank') Sensors Energy and AutomationLaboratory
      | . The lab had been hired by the
      a(href='http://www.fhcrc.org/', target='_blank') Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
      | to create a Dietary Data Recording device which would better record the dietary intake of their study participants. The lab&apos;s work revolved around the development of an application that was run on Android devices. Levi was originally the sole developer for this, and some of the application&apos;s functionalities include: recording accelerometer and magnetometer measurements and associating them with individual video frames in order to analyze the volume of some food; firing a laser grid via an external, custom-made, Bluetooth-compatible device; recording and playing audio and video; scanning barcodes; uploading and downloading data from the databases on our server; recording dietary info in an SQLite database; parsing SQL data to and from an XML file.
